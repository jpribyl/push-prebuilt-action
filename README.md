# Push pre-built JS/TS/Docker GitHub Action

This GitHub action reduces CI execution time by pre-building JavaScript, TypeScript, and Docker container actions.

## What does this action do to make it pre-built?

### JavaScript / TypeScript action

This action compiles JavaScript GitHub Action into a single file (with cache files if you want), and pushes it to GitHub.
Compilation is powered by [zeit/ncc](https://github.com/zeit/ncc).

TypeScript is also supported. Specify your \*.ts file to `action.yml#runs.main`

Since there is no need to commit `node_modules`, your GitHub Action can be released quickly
with less time for pushes during action development and pulls during CI execution.

> This Action written in TypeScript has been compiled by itself and released.
> [See pre-built commit](https://github.com/satackey/push-js-action/tree/release-master)

### Docker container action

This action builds an image from your Dockerfile, and pushes it to the Docker registry,
and rewrites `action.yml#rans.image` by pushed tag.

The job just pulls Docker image when using the action, and there's no time to build the Dockerfile.

## Usage

- [JavaScript / TypeScript](#javascript--typescript)
- [Docker container](#docker-container)

The description `action.yml` can be read as `action.yaml`.

### JavaScript / TypeScript

#### Example (Step only)

```yaml
- uses: satackey/push-prebuilt-action@v0.1
  with:
    push-branch: release-master
```

[Click here](#javascript--typescript-action-example) to see workflow example

#### Basic flow

1. This action detects that your action is a JS/TS action by `action.yml`
1. This action compiles a file (e.g. `index.js`) specified in `action.yml#runs.main` into `dist/index.js`
1. Replaces the value of `runs.main` with `dist/index.js`.
1. Remove files exclude `/action.yml` and `dist/*`.
1. Checkout a new branch with the name specified in `push-branch`.
1. Commit all changes.
1. Force push new branch (and tags) to the `origin`

- `release-tags` optional  
   The names to tag the compiled file commit.
